# Films

Visualize movie consumption around the year(s). The graph shows every movie I've seen in the course of four years starting with 2014. The color gradient shows how high I rated the movie. A rating of 5 is the best and therefore darker in color as movies rated lower.
Each circle represents a year.

## Graph

The circle graph is based on the great http://nicgirault.github.io/circosJS/demo/

## Data
If you want to remix the graph you need to prepare a data sheet with a value that corresponds to a specific day in the year.
In my case it's a specific rating for each movie watched on a specific day.
